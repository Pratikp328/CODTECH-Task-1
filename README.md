1. Project Objective
The objective of this project was to create a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a full-stack web developer and BI analyst. The website serves as a professional digital profile for potential employers and collaborators.

2. Key Features
Homepage: A visually appealing landing page featuring an introduction, a short bio, and a personal photo or avatar. The page includes navigation links to other sections of the site.

About Section: Provides a detailed description of my professional journey, skillset (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, etc.), certifications (including Tableau for data visualization), and interests (sports, traveling, music).

Skills Section: A structured list or icons showcasing technical skills in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and business intelligence tools (Power BI, Tableau).

Projects Section: This section displays some of my completed projects, including:

Netflix Dashboard (2022): Visualizes global Netflix users' data.
Unemployment Analysis (India 2005-2015): Displays dashboards analyzing unemployment trends.
Each project includes a brief description, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.

Experience Section: Contains information about my internship at Infosys Springboard, where I worked on HTML and CSS projects, and other relevant professional experiences.

Contact Section: A form to get in touch, linked to an email service (via basic JavaScript), allowing visitors to send messages directly.

3. Technical Details
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring that it adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Interactive Elements: Basic JavaScript was used to add interactive features like form validation, navigation smooth scrolling, and animated elements for user engagement.

CSS Flexbox & Grid: CSS Flexbox and Grid systems were used extensively to create a clean, modern layout.

Cross-browser Compatibility: The website is tested across multiple browsers to ensure consistency.

4. Challenges & Solutions
Cross-browser styling: Ensuring the website looks consistent across different browsers was a challenge. This was tackled by using browser-specific CSS prefixes and testing in multiple environments.

Form Handling: Implementing form validation using basic JavaScript helped ensure the user inputs are valid before submission.

5. Future Enhancements
Project Expansions: Plan to add more projects with live demos, especially in web development and data visualization.

Advanced Features: Enhance JavaScript interactivity by adding dynamic elements like a portfolio filter, lightbox gallery for project images, or an integrated blog section.
